/// Contract Overview
///
/// The contracts of Phala Network will handle two kinds of requests: Command and Query.
/// (we name Query as `Request` in the following code)
///
/// The Commands are allowed to update the state of contract. They are first sent to the blockchain, and then distributed
/// the according contract. Such design ensures the state consistency across multiple instances of the same contract, since
/// all the instances will reach the same state after replaying all the Commands.
/// Such property limits the use of random generator in our contracts: you can only generate random with on-chain entropy,
/// because off-chain random generation can break the state consistency. We will show an example in the following code.
///
/// The Queries are not allowed to change the state of contract. They are directly sent to contract through the local rpc
/// endpoint. Since they are off-chain requests, they can be sent and then real-time processed.
///
/// For the advanced usage of HTTP request in contract, refer to `btc_price_bot.rs`.

/// The Commands to this contract
///
/// Commands need to be first posted on chain then will be dispatched to the contract, that why we define the `PastebinCommand`
/// in phala_types to be used globally.
/// They can change the state of the contract, with no responses.
